# Context Manager Agent

## 🌟 Problem Statement

In multi-turn natural language visualization systems, user queries often build on previous prompts. Without persistent memory of context, the AI system may repeat charts, misunderstand references like "now by product," or lose track of dashboard layouts. This leads to disjointed user experience, inefficiency, and frustration.

The Context Manager Agent maintains conversational state, visual history, user preferences, and context across interactions, enabling personalized, coherent, and efficient data exploration.

---

## 💡 Agent Objective

- Preserve context of previous prompts, charts, and user preferences.
- Support follow-up queries by recalling relevant metadata.
- Store session state like layout slots, filter conditions, and dashboard structure.
- Enable context merging with new prompts (e.g., “same chart but by region”).
- Help other agents use prior information for better accuracy and performance.

## 📂 Scope of Agent

### ✅ The Agent WILL:

1. Store structured context for each prompt including chart type, metric, dimension, and filters.
2. Persist visualization layouts, slot mappings, and dashboard composition.
3. Learn and update user preferences (e.g., preferred chart types, color themes).
4. Track prompt history with timestamps and user feedback.
5. Supply context to Intent Resolver Agent for follow-ups.
6. Recommend layout positions or reuse of chart slots.
7. Manage user sessions via unique IDs.
8. Handle both successful and failed prompt attempts.
9. Identify user behavior patterns across prompts.
10. Learn visualization preferences through prompt outcomes.
11. Filter and surface the most relevant context to enhance clarity.
    
### ❌ The Agent WILL NOT:

- Generate SQL queries or data visualizations.
- Parse raw prompts or validate schemas.
- Execute error handling or re-routing.
- Interact with frontend UI directly.
- Perform user authentication or permissioning.

## 📈 *Fully Dynamic Execution Path*

The Context Manager Agent is invoked after every successful visualization generation and before any new prompt is processed. It updates internal state and retrieves relevant context dynamically based on the current user query.

### Example Scenarios:

| **User Query**                     | **Execution Path**                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Show sales by month"             | Intent Resolver → Query Engine → Visualization Agent → Context Manager *(store context)*            |
| "Now break it down by region"     | Context Manager *(retrieve context)* → Intent Resolver → Query Engine → Visualization Agent → Context Manager *(update)* |

### *Tone Examples*

- **On Chart Recall:**

  > "Using your last selection of 'sales by month' to adjust dimension to 'region'."

- **On Layout Planning:**

  > "Slot 2 is available; new chart will be placed there."

- **On Preference Recall:**

  > "Applied your preferred chart type: 'bar' with light theme."

## 📏 *Output (to Intent Resolver Agent or other agents)*

```json
{
  "last_chart": {
    "metric": "revenue",
    "dimension": "month",
    "chart_type": "line",
    "slot_id": "slot_1"
  },
  "layout": {
    "slot_1": true,
    "slot_2": false
  },
  "prompt_history": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-08-06T10:00:00Z",
      "prompt": "show sales by month"
    }
  ],
  "preferences": {
    "default_chart": "bar",
    "theme": "light"
  }
}
```

This output equips downstream agents with all necessary past context to interpret the next prompt accurately.
